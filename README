ada-dabreceiver is a simple re-implementation of
the dab software of the sdr-j project using the Ada programming
language (and the Gnat compiling system in particular).

My interest in the Ada language is old. 35 years ago I was 
involved in the development of an Ada compiler, and I participated in the
review of the 95 version of the  Ada language.
However then I went on doing other things.

This implementation is based on a revival of my interest in writing decent
programs (i.e. readable and comprehensable for non-authors of the programs)
and on the interest how Ada developed.
Learning a language from a book does not work - at least
for me - so I decided to write an Ada program.

For compiling the program you will need
a. Ada (preferably Gnat)
b. GtkAda for the very, very simple GUI
c. libraries for portaudio, fftw3, rtlsdr and faad

The GPR file, for generating an exectable is in the main directory of the
sources. Settings are for including a library for the airspy and
for the SDRplay. Just adapt to your needs.
