 * Portable Audio I/O Library
 * Ring Buffer utility.
 *
 * Author: Phil Burk, http://www.softsynth.com
 * modified for SMP safety on Mac OS X by Bjorn Roche
 * modified for SMP safety on Linux by Leland Lucius
 * also, allowed for const where possible
 * modified for multiple-byte-sized data elements by Sven Fischer 
 *
 * Note that this is safe only for a single-thread reader and a
 * single-thread writer.
 *
 * This program uses the PortAudio Portable Audio Library.
